This angle testing was accomplished with this setup.  The panel is mounted on a camera tripod, and turned to different angles to the sun.  The box with the switches is our load box, the switches permit various series and parallel combinations.			</td>		</tr>		<tr><td colspan=2 height=15></td></tr>		<tr>			<td width=150 align=center valign=middle>				<a href="antarctic_testing.html" onClick="return pop640x480(this, 'Pictures Window')"><img src="antarctic_testing_thumb.jpg" width=133 height=100 border=0 alt="antarctic testing"></a>			</td>			<td width=550 align=left valign=middle>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim Lever brought the 12-cell test panels with him to Antarctica during the 2004-2005 season.  Using the setup shown here, he was able to better quantify and validate our estimates of how much power is available due to reflections and scattering by the near-infinite snowfields of the Ross Ice Shelf and Antarctic plateau.  Based on these measurements and some further modeling, we estimate some 40% of the robot's power will come from snow reflections, even on those panels not facing the sun!  A formal writeup is awaiting publication.			</td>		</tr>		<tr><td colspan=2 height=15></td></tr>		<tr>			<td width=150 align=center valign=middle>				<a href="IV.html" onClick="return pop640x480(this, 'Pictures Window')"><img src="IV_thumb.gif" width=133 height=100 border=0 alt="I-V data"></a>			</td>			<td width=550 align=left valign=middle>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is data from the testing we performed to characterize the Current-Voltage curve of the 12-cell test panels at various angles to the sun.

An important piece of data when developing that model is the angle of the sun above the horizon, measured here with a crude sextant.			</td>		</tr>		<tr><td colspan=2 height=15></td></tr>		<tr>			<td width=150 align=center valign=middle>				<a href="snowfield_test.html" onClick="return pop640x480(this, 'Pictures Window')"><img src="snowfield_test_thumb.jpg" width=133 height=100 border=0 alt="roof testing"></a>			</td>			<td width=550 align=left valign=middle>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one can see from this picture, this kind of testing was rather cold work, when temperatures in the middle of the day barely reached 10 degrees above zero!			</td>		</tr>		<tr><td colspan=2 height=15></td></tr>		<tr>			<td width=700 height=10 colspan=2></td>		</tr>	</table><!-- Now begins the footer, text-only section for navigation, copyright, etc. -->	<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH="700" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">		<tr>			<td height=3 bgcolor="#0F3C28"></td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td height="20" align="center" valign="middle">			<font color="#FF8822">			<a href="../../index.html">[Main]</a> | <a href="../../mission/mis_index.html">[Mission]</a> | <a href="../../science/sci_index.html">[Science]</a> | <a href="../../papers/pap_index.html">[Papers]</a> | <a href="../../pictures/pic_index.html">[Pictures]</a> | <a href="../../team/tem_index.html">[Team]</a>			</font>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td height="30" align="center" valign="top" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">				<font size=-1><font face="Arial, Verdana"><!-- 				Last Updated on 7/14/2005 by <a href="mailto:alex.streeter@alum.dartmouth.org">Streeter</a> -->				<br>Site &#169; Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, Hanover, N.H.</font></font>			</td>		</tr>	</table></center></body></html>
