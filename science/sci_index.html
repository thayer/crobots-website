Two field deployments, a week-long circuit around Summit Camp in year two and a 1,500-km traverse from Summit to NEEM and back in year three, will collect data on snow-surface characteristics and elevations as ground truth for satellite data and air samples to assess spatial and temporal variations in atmospheric chemistry near the snow surface. Ground-based data collection is crucial to furthering our understanding of glaciology and environmental sciences in Greenland. This collaborative project among Dartmouth College, UNH and CRREL builds on a successful Small Grant for Exploratory Research, a student-based pilot study that designed, fabricated, and field-tested the simple four-wheel drive, solar-powered Cool Robot. This project will provide critical performance data on robot mobility, power systems, navigation and communications over a vast polar snowfield and thus forge a path to expand the use of mobile robots to support science and logistics operations in the Greenland. Potential uses of the Cool Robot are traverses to collect glaciological data, snow characterization to study climate change, biological sampling, atmospheric and snow chemistry and photochemistry surveys, micrometeorite sampling and site inspections for meteorite fields, crevasse detection in advance of manned traverses, airfield geophysical surveys, and routine snow-road surveys. Arrays of mobile robots would allow scientific instruments to be dynamically positioned based on preliminary data or to respond to specific events. Array-based campaigns could include study of the polar atmosphere, magnetosphere, troposphere, and sub-glacial geology using a diverse set of instruments: magnetometers, GPS receivers, snow property measurement, and ground penetrating radar. The project supports instrument development and deployment, increased logistics capability and reduced costs using the Cool Robot, and is an opportunity to train students in engineering and arctic research. </p></td><!-- 			<td align=left>This page has been "Under Construction" for a remarkably long time - from the time of the whole Cool Robots website's inception until the middle of October, 2005.  That means this one single page has been under construction for something like 15 months.  For all that construction time, I'm afraid the final product may be a bit underwhelming.  For that, I apologize, the actual work of the robot itself tended to crowd out such auxiliary project activities as public relations.<br><br>There is nothing auspicious about October, 2005, that this page should suddenly have actual contents, but it does happen to fall some time <i>after</i> our field testing time in Greenland at the end of July and beginning of August of this past year.  Through the wonder of modern communications technology, I was able to post daily field reports on our progress from the comfortable interior of the <a href="http://www.vecopolar.com/SingleHTMLTextArea.aspx?P=8f88809bd60f431fa917678e2426759e" target=extern>Summit Camp</a> <a href="http://www.summitcamp.org/Sections/VirtualTour/bighouse" target=extern>Big House</a>, located roughly in the geographic center of the island.  Those daily postings used to occupy the index page of the Cool Robots website.  However, since they are no longer really current, they have been relocated here, since the field testing comprises the most real science that we have conducted.<br><br>If you would like to read the field reports, you have two options.
